 * Every Layer has an implicit Scope which doesn't appear in it's requirements (R),
 * and is the Scope passed to buildWithScope.
 *
 * The main difference is that Effect.scoped provides a scope that's newly
 * created with Scope.make. On the other hand, Layer.scope forks the implicit
 * Scope and provides the child to the scoped Effect.
 *
 * This results in the scoped Effect's release being executed when the implicit
 * Scope is closed (if you recall the previous chapter, acquireRelease adds
 * the release effect to the Scope with addFinalizer).
