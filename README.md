### The practical guide I wish existed while learning [@Effect-TS](https://github.com/Effect-TS/)

This guide explores some concepts from the new version of
[Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/io), and is written from the point of view
of a casual fp-ts 2 user.

### Usage

Start reading from [001-basic.ts](001-basic.ts)!

### Local environment

1. Install the packages in package.json with the package manager of your choice.
   (e.g. `npm install`)
2. Any file in this project can be run with the `run-file` script in
   package.json (e.g. `npm run run-file 001-basic.ts` or
   `yarn run-file 001-basic.ts`). You may also use `tsx` directly
   (`npx tsx 001-basic.ts`).
