/*
 * Effect has 3 main types of errors:
 *
 * 1) Failure
 * Generated using Effect.fail and appears in the E type of Effect<R, E, A>
 * (which is also known as the failure channel).
 *
 * These are also called 'expected errors' or 'typed errors' or 'recoverable errors'.
 *
 * They are errors which the developer expects to happen, part of the domain,
 * and part of the program's control flow.
 *
 * In spirit they are similar to checked exceptions.
 *
 * 2) Defect
 * Generated using Effect.die (and some other similar functions), they don't
 * appear in the Effect<R,E,A> type.
 *
 * Also known as 'unexpected errors' or 'untyped errors' or 'unrecoverable errors'.
 * (NOTE: despite the name there are ways to recover from them but it's way
 * more verbose compared to failures).
 *
 * These are unexpected errors which are not part of the domain, nor the
 * control flow.
 *
 * While it doesn't appear in the type Effect<R,E,A>, the Effect runtime keeps
 * track of these errors in a data structure called Cause (more on this later),
 * and there are functions that allow you to access the Cause and analyze it.
 *
 * In spirit, similar to unchecked exceptions.
 *
 * 3) Interruption
 * Generated with Effect.interrupt to interrupt the executing Fiber, or
 * Fiber.interrupt(fiber) to interrupt a `fiber`. We will talk more about
 * fibers later.
 *
 * An interruption will cause the fiber to return an Exit.Failure containing
 * a Cause.interrupt.

/* Building Errors
 * ===============
 *
 * Until now we used string literals in the failure channel of the example
 * effects we built. That was mainly for easing you into the concepts.
 *
 * In reality it's better to fail with an object that has a _tag field.
 * This is because Effect comes with a few functions built specifically to
 * handle "tagged" error objects in a typesafe way (i.e. catchTag).
 *
 * To define such errors you can use:
 *  - interface extending Data.Case in combination with Data.tagged
 *  - plain Typescript interfaces
 *
 *  - Data.TaggedClass
 *  - plain Typescript classes
 */

// interface extending Data.Case in combination with Data.TaggedClass
// NOTE: this is the most convenient option if you want to use interfaces
export interface FooError extends Data.Case {
  readonly _tag: "FooError";
  readonly error: string;
}

export const FooError = Data.tagged<FooError>("FooError");

// plain Typescript interfaces with corresponding constructor
// NOTE: this is the minimalist option if you want to use interfaces
export interface BatError {
  readonly _tag: "BatError";
  readonly error: unknown;
}

export const BatError = (error: unknown): BatError => ({
  _tag: "BatError",
  error,
});

// Data.TaggedClass
// most concise option using classes
export class FooErrorClass extends Data.TaggedClass("FooError")<{
  readonly error: string;
}> {}

// plain Typescript classes
export class BarError {
  readonly _tag = "BarError";
  constructor(readonly error: string) {}
}

export class BazError {
  readonly _tag = "BazError";
  constructor(readonly error: string) {}
}

/*
 * The nice thing about using classes is you can define the type and
 * constructor in one go. But many people dislike them, so it's your choice
 * which option to use.
 *
 * Errors defined through Data have the added benefit of providing an Equal
 * implementation. That allows to compare errors by value instead of reference.
 */

import * as Equal from "@effect/data/Equal";

// This is true because the argument to FooError is compared by value
