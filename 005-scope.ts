/* In this chapter we explore Scope.
 *
 * It is useful to understand Layer in the following chapter, but since Scope
 * can be used on it's own without Layer, it's being introduced here first.
 *
 * What is Scope? It's a datatype to model the lifetime of resources.
 *
 * In practice it is a collection of finalizers. It has 3 main methods:
 *
 *  - addFinalizer: adds a new finalizer to the Scope
 *
 *    A finalizer is an effect to be run when the Scope is closed, somewhat
 *    like a destructor in OOP
 *
 *  - close: closes the Scope executing all the finalizers that were added to it
 *
 *  - fork: creates a child Scope from the given Scope. When the parent Scope
 *    is closed, it's children are closed as well.
 */

/* We mentioned resources above. What is a resource?
 *
 * They are also known as "scoped effect". They are effects that require a Scope to run.
 *
 * In types they look like this:
 *
 *  Effect.Effect<Scope.Scope, DatabaseConnectionError, DatabaseConnection>
 *
 *
 * The most common way to create a "scoped effect" is the `acquireRelease`
 * function.
 *
 * As you can see from the return types acquireRelease returns us an effect
 * that needs a Scope to run (thus "Scoped effect").
 *
 * The Scope will be used to manage the lifetime of the resource.
 *
 * Under the hood the "Scoped effect" returned from `acquireRelease` does the
 * following:
 *
 * 1) Puts itself into an uninterruptible region, ensuring that both the
 *    acquire and release effects are executed without interruptions
 *
 * 2) Gets a Scope from the environment (that's why Scope is in the R generic),
 *    and creates a child with fork
 *
 * 3) Executes the acquire effect. If it is successful, the release effect is
 *    added to the forked scope with addFinalizer
 *
 * 4) Returns the A value from the acquire effect.
 *
 * Let's define a basic resource that implements the FileDescriptor interface.

 * benefit of being a spiritual equivalent to try-catch.
 *
 * If the acquire effect succeeds, the end
 * effect is guaranteed to be run regardless of the use effect's result (similar to a finally clause).
 *
 * That was still quite long to write, and using scopes is very common.
 *

 * acquireUseRelease dance for you, providing a Scope to it's argument, and

/* Bonus side note.
 *
 * acquireUseRelease is kind of a specialized version of acquireRelease.
 *
 * The main difference is acquireUseRelease knows when you are done using the
 * resource created with acquire (because you provide a use effect!), so it
 * also knows when it can execute release.
 *
 * On the other hand, with acquireRelease your whole code is the use effect,
 * so you have to go through closing a Scope to signal when your "use" has
 * completed.
 *
 * As an exercise, we can write acquireUseRelease in terms of acquireRelease.
 * The types are little more lax compared to the one provided by Effect, but
 * this is just to drive the point home.
