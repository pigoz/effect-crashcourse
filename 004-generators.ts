/*
 * TLDR: With generators you can write Effect code that looks imperative!

 * but considering the limitations of JavaScript and TypeScript, it's quite
 * amazing that this is possible at all.
 *
 * Code snippets are advised to write out the `gen(function *($)` and `yield* $()`
 * boilerplate. For reference, I setup mine like this:
